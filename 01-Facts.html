                  <p>
                    Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries
                    to the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau.
                    There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered
                    the potential of these beloved beans.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he
                    noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree,
                    his goats became so energetic that they did not want to
                    sleep at night.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local
                    monastery, who made a drink with the berries and found that
                    it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer.
                    The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the
                    monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to
                    spread.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As word moved east and coffee reached the Arabian peninsula,
                    it began a journey which would bring these beans across the
                    globe.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Coffee cultivation and trade began on the Arabian Peninsula.
                    By the 15th century, coffee was being grown in the Yemeni
                    district of Arabia and by the 16th century it was known in
                    Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Coffee was not only enjoyed in homes, but also in the many
                    public coffee houses — called qahveh khaneh — which began to
                    appear in cities across the Near East. The popularity of the
                    coffee houses was unequaled and people frequented them for
                    all kinds of social activity.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Not only did the patrons drink coffee and engage in
                    conversation, but they also listened to music, watched
                    performers, played chess and kept current on the news.
                    Coffee houses quickly became such an important center for
                    the exchange of information that they were often referred to
                    as “Schools of the Wise.”
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    With thousands of pilgrims visiting the holy city of Mecca
                    each year from all over the world, knowledge of this “wine
                    of Araby” began to spread.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Coffee Comes to Europe</h2>
                  <p>
                    European travelers to the Near East brought back stories of
                    an unusual dark black beverage. By the 17th century, coffee
                    had made its way to Europe and was becoming popular across
                    the continent.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Some people reacted to this new beverage with suspicion or
                    fear, calling it the “bitter invention of Satan.” The local
                    clergy condemned coffee when it came to Venice in 1615. The
                    controversy was so great that Pope Clement VIII was asked to
                    intervene. He decided to taste the beverage for himself
                    before making a decision, and found the drink so satisfying
                    that he gave it papal approval.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Despite such controversy, coffee houses were quickly
                    becoming centers of social activity and communication in the
                    major cities of England, Austria, France, Germany and
                    Holland. In England “penny universities” sprang up, so
                    called because for the price of a penny one could purchase a
                    cup of coffee and engage in stimulating conversation.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Coffee began to replace the common breakfast drink beverages
                    of the time — beer and wine. Those who drank coffee instead
                    of alcohol began the day alert and energized, and not
                    surprisingly, the quality of their work was greatly
                    improved. (We like to think of this a precursor to the
                    modern office coffee service.)
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    By the mid-17th century, there were over 300 coffee houses
                    in London, many of which attracted like-minded patrons,
                    including merchants, shippers, brokers and artists.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Many businesses grew out of these specialized coffee houses.
                    Lloyd's of London, for example, came into existence at the
                    Edward Lloyd's Coffee House.
                  </p>

                  <h2>The New World</h2>
                  <p>
                    In the mid-1600's, coffee was brought to New Amsterdam,
                    later called New York by the British.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Though coffee houses rapidly began to appear, tea continued
                    to be the favored drink in the New World until 1773, when
                    the colonists revolted against a heavy tax on tea imposed by
                    King George III. The revolt, known as the Boston Tea Party,
                    would forever change the American drinking preference to
                    coffee.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    "Coffee - the favorite drink of the civilized world." -
                    Thomas Jefferson
                  </p>

                  <h2>Plantations Around the World</h2>
                  <p>
                    As demand for the beverage continued to spread, there was
                    fierce competition to cultivate coffee outside of Arabia.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The Dutch finally got seedlings in the latter half of the
                    17th century. Their first attempts to plant them in India
                    failed, but they were successful with their efforts in
                    Batavia, on the island of Java in what is now Indonesia.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The plants thrived and soon the Dutch had a productive and
                    growing trade in coffee. They then expanded the cultivation
                    of coffee trees to the islands of Sumatra and Celebes.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Coming to the Americas</h2>
                  <p>
                    In 1714, the Mayor of Amsterdam presented a gift of a young
                    coffee plant to King Louis XIV of France. The King ordered
                    it to be planted in the Royal Botanical Garden in Paris. In
                    1723, a young naval officer, Gabriel de Clieu obtained a
                    seedling from the King's plant. Despite a challenging voyage
                    — complete with horrendous weather, a saboteur who tried to
                    destroy the seedling, and a pirate attack — he managed to
                    transport it safely to Martinique.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once planted, the seedling not only thrived, but it’s
                    credited with the spread of over 18 million coffee trees on
                    the island of Martinique in the next 50 years. Even more
                    incredible is that this seedling was the parent of all
                    coffee trees throughout the Caribbean, South and Central
                    America.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The famed Brazilian coffee owes its existence to Francisco
                    de Mello Palheta, who was sent by the emperor to French
                    Guiana to get coffee seedlings. The French were not willing
                    to share, but the French Governor's wife, captivated by his
                    good looks, gave him a large bouquet of flowers before he
                    left— buried inside were enough coffee seeds to begin what
                    is today a billion-dollar industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Missionaries and travelers, traders and colonists continued
                    to carry coffee seeds to new lands, and coffee trees were
                    planted worldwide. Plantations were established in
                    magnificent tropical forests and on rugged mountain
                    highlands. Some crops flourished, while others were
                    short-lived. New nations were established on coffee
                    economies. Fortunes were made and lost. By the end of the
                    18th century, coffee had become one of the world's most
                    profitable export crops. After crude oil, coffee is the most
                    sought commodity in the world.
